    <h2>In-Depth Case Studies</h2>
    <article>
        <h3>Autonomous Vehicles: Balancing Safety and Accountability</h3>
        <p>
            This case explores the ethical implications of the 2018 Uber self-driving car incident in Tempe, Arizona, 
            where a pedestrian was fatally struck. The key issues include the responsibility of engineers in ensuring 
            rigorous testing, accountability in failure scenarios, and the broader societal impact of deploying 
            autonomous technologies without sufficient safeguards.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> By examining this case, we uncover systemic challenges in prioritizing safety over 
        commercial pressure and the lack of regulatory frameworks addressing autonomous vehicle safety.</p>

        <h3>Sustainability in Civil Engineering</h3>
        <p>
            Engineers often face trade-offs between cost, speed, and sustainability. A notable example is the 
            construction of buildings that prioritize affordability over long-term environmental impact.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This case demonstrates the need for engineers to advocate for sustainable practices, 
        even when facing pressure from stakeholders to minimize costs, ensuring the planet’s well-being for future generations.</p>
