    <h2>In-Depth Case Studies</h2>

    <!-- Case Study 1 -->
    <article>
      <h3>Autonomous Vehicles: Balancing Safety and Accountability</h3>
      <img src="images/autonomous-vehicles.jpg" alt="Autonomous Vehicles">
      <p>
        This case explores the ethical implications of the 2018 Uber self-driving car incident in Tempe, Arizona,
        where a pedestrian was fatally struck. The key issues include the responsibility of engineers in ensuring
        rigorous testing, accountability in failure scenarios, and the broader societal impact of deploying
        autonomous technologies without sufficient safeguards.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> By examining this case, we uncover systemic challenges in prioritizing safety over
      commercial pressure and the lack of regulatory frameworks addressing autonomous vehicle safety.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Ethical Questions:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the responsibility of engineers in ensuring the safety of autonomous systems?</li>
        <li>How should accountability be assigned when an autonomous system fails?</li>
        <li>What role should regulatory bodies play in overseeing emerging technologies?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Sustainability in Civil Engineering: The Rana Plaza Collapse</h3>
      <img src="images/rana-plaza.jpg" alt="Rana Plaza Collapse">
      <p>
        The Rana Plaza collapse in 2013 was one of the deadliest industrial disasters in history, killing over 1,100
        people. The building, which housed garment factories, was constructed with substandard materials and without
        proper oversight. Engineers faced ethical dilemmas regarding safety standards, corruption, and the pressure to
        reduce costs.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This case highlights the ethical obligation of engineers to adhere to safety standards
      and the consequences of compromising integrity due to external pressures.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Ethical Questions:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>How should engineers respond to pressure from clients or employers to cut corners?</li>
        <li>What is the role of engineers in advocating for safe working conditions?</li>
        <li>How can systemic corruption be addressed within the engineering profession?</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Case Study 3 -->
    <article>
      <h3>Data Privacy and Social Media: The Cambridge Analytica Scandal</h3>
      <img src="images/cambridge-analytica.jpg" alt="Cambridge Analytica">
      <p>
        In 2018, it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica had harvested personal data from millions of Facebook users
        without consent, using it for political advertising purposes. This case raises ethical concerns about data
        privacy, user consent, and the manipulation of information.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The scandal underscores the ethical responsibility of engineers and companies to
      protect user data and be transparent about how it's used.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Ethical Questions:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>What are the ethical obligations of companies in handling user data?</li>
        <li>How should engineers approach user consent and data protection?</li>
        <li>What are the implications of data misuse on public trust and democracy?</li>
      </ul>
